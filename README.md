### This is my backend final assessment. If you're not from TAFE, you shouldn't be here.

They said to be organised, so here is the organisation. The files can be found on openlearning, so I don't think it makes a difference either way.

For information on how to start up components 1, 2, and 3, please check their respective `README.md` files.
For information about component four, click on `Component 4.md`.
